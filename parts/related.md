There have been attempts of using fractal compression in the business and
open source community in the past.

Historically Michael Barnsley led development of fractal compression in 1987
and was granted several patents on the technology.
This made it difficult for developers to experiment and grow the interest on
the technology, and thus not many project exist today based on the fractal
compression scheme. Michael Barnsley and Alan Sloan formed Iterated Systems Inc.
which was granted over 20 additional patents related to fractal compression.

The most widely known and successful implementation of fractal compression is by
onOne Software company, which developed a fractal compression scheme (under the
Iterated Systems Inc. license) as a Photoshop plugin.
Another successful real world usage of fractal compression is by Microsoft in
its Encarta multimedia encyclopedia, also under license.

In the Open Source world, Ullrich Hafner developed a library called Fiasco.
It is now used by the Netpbm library and toolkit.
Femtosoft provided another example implementation.

Numerous research papers have been published during the past few years
discussing possible solutions to improve fractal algorithms and encoding
hardware.
