Conclusions
===========
Fractal Image Compression is a much promising and still young technology that
can fit well in many areas of the multimedia systems' world.
Despite the great compression time, the benefits of compression and resolution
independence are much broader (for example, mapping services like [google
maps][gm])

The Future
----------
The project isn't finished. There are many things to experiment and play with.

New partition schemes ([Quadtrees][q], HV partitioning) and
optimizations ([Histogram][h] grouping, [multithreading][mt])
that can yield better results faster, are yet to be discovered and implemented.

The base is here and everyone can join and expand the limits.
