Project Description
===================

The project's goal, is to provide a reusable library for fractal compression of
images. Along with the library, comes a small application, indicating the
library's usage and serving as an example and proof of concept of the ideas
behind fractal compression.

&raquo; What is it ?
---------------------
Fractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images, based on
fractals. The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on
the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image.
